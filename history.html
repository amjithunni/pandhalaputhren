                <h3>Origins and Legends</h3>
                <p>The history of Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple is deeply intertwined with ancient legends and spiritual narratives. The temple is believed to be one of the five Sastha temples established by Lord Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. The primary deity, Lord Ayyappan, is revered as the son of Lord Shiva and Mohini (the female incarnation of Lord Vishnu), symbolizing the harmony of Shaivism and Vaishnavism.</p>
                <p>One of the most prominent legends associated with Sabarimala is that of Lord Ayyappan's human incarnation as Manikandan, the adopted son of the Pandalam King. Manikandan grew up displaying divine powers and ultimately fulfilled his mission of vanquishing the demoness Mahishi. After his victory, he chose Sabarimala as his abode, instructing the king to build a temple there.</p>

                <h3>Historical Development and Significance</h3>
                <p>Over centuries, Sabarimala has evolved into a major pilgrimage center, drawing devotees from diverse backgrounds. Historical records and archaeological findings suggest the temple's existence dates back to at least the 12th century, with various renovations and expansions occurring over time. The unique pilgrimage tradition, including the mandatory 41-day 'Vratham' and the arduous trek through the forest, has been meticulously preserved, emphasizing self-control, devotion, and spiritual purity.</p>
                <p>The temple's location amidst the dense Periyar Tiger Reserve adds to its mystique and spiritual allure. It has faced various challenges throughout history, including invasions and natural calamities, but has always been restored by the unwavering faith of its devotees. The 'Makaravilakku' and 'Mandala-Kalam' festivals are peak pilgrimage seasons, witnessing millions of devotees undertaking the journey to seek Lord Ayyappan's blessings.</p>
